msgid "Subcircuits are used to bring more clarity into a schematic. This is very "
"useful in large circuits or in circuits, in which a component block appears "
"several times."

msgid "In Qucs, each schematic containing a subcircuit port is a subcircuit. You "
"can get a subcircuit port by using the toolbar, the components listview (in "
"lumped components) or the menu (Insert->Insert port). After placing all "
"subcircuit ports (two for example) you need to save the schematic (e.g. "
"CTRL-S). By taking a look into the content listview (figure 1) you see that "
"now there is a \"2-port\" right beside the schematic name (column \"Note\")."
" This note marks all documents which are subcircuits. Now change to a "
"schematic where you want to use the subcircuit. Then press on the subcircuit"
" name (content listview). By entering the document area again, you see that "
"you now can place the subcirciut into the main circuit. Do so and complete "
"the schematic. You can now perform a simulation. The result is the same as "
"if all the components of the subcircuit are placed into the circuit "
"directly."

msgid "If you select a subcircuit component (click on its symbol in the schematic) "
"you can step into the subcircuit schematic by pressing CTRL-I (of course, "
"this function is also reachable via toolbar and via menu). You can step back"
" by pressing CTRL-H."

msgid "If you do not like the component symbol of a subcircuit, you can draw your "
"own symbol and put the component text at your favourite position. Just make "
"the subcircuit schematic the current and go to the menu: File->Edit Circuit "
"Symbol. If you have not yet drawn a symbol for this circuit. A simple symbol"
" is created automatically. You now can edit this symbol by painting lines "
"and arcs. After finished, save it. Now place it on another schematic, and "
"you have a new symbol."

msgid "Just like all other components, subcircuits can have parameters. To create "
"your own parameters, go back to the editor where you edited the subcircuit "
"symbol and double-click on the subcircuit parameter text (SUB1 in the Figure"
" 1). A dialog apperas and you now can fill in parameterswith default values "
"and descriptions. When you are ready, close the dialog and save the "
"subcircuit. In every schematic where the subcircuit is placed, it owns the "
"new parameters which can be edited as in all other components."
